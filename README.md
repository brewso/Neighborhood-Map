This app is designed to show my favorite key points around the Twin cities metro area.  
There is a search function in a drop down list format that allows the user to search for a specific location out of the key points.  
Clicking on either the list item or the map marker will center the map, zoom to that location, and pop up an info window.  
The info window includes a google street view or better picture of that location along with some info on the specific location.  
There is also a button that allows the user to view a random set of *Flickr* images!  

In the upper left hand of the list is a box to display *Accuweather* current conditions, accuweather icon for the condition, and temp.

Location data provided by Google.
